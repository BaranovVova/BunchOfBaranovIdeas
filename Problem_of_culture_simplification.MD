In one of my youtube podcasts I describe the problem that has our modern musical culture.
Modern music lacks the complexity that was in the 1950-60's.
If you compare the piece of music from average car radio from era of John Coltrane to the music that we hear now from ipod you notice that
it is dramatically simpler. I'm not a pro in music theory but I can understand the basics of harmony.
Modern music is simpler not just in harmony sense but also in rhythmic patterns and melody itself.
Here I can redirect you to the famous painting of Esher that illustrates this concept.

If deep dive to the simulation hypothesis this issue can be viewed from the optics of crude resolution of this simulation.
And resource limitations of the computer that actually execute the code of our reality.
From the science of game engine design we know there are several levels of details in every game engine that exist today.
When the posthuman civilization in Bostrom terms launched the simulation they probably had a bunch of copies of the current world that is a branch of the same original world.
And memory that is allocated is very limited. so they have some kind of greedy algorithm that redistribute amount of free memory with automatic reduce in resolution
So maybe our musical industry is just a reflection of bad taste.
More simpler mems just propagate more easily to the network.
We hungry for content of tik tok like services that exploits the first signal system in Kanenman terms.
