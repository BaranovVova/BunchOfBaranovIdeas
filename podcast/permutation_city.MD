Idea of a podcast:
If we live in simulation is gotta be some tutorial for copies of the real people of how to live in a simulation.
Podcast describes some reverse enginering stuff about how engine works. What is under the hood.
This information can be gathered from books, science fiction, movies and my own thoughs and ideas.
Make a several videos in the woods, river. Take nature sights. 
Scenes witch not include people.

First video of a podcast
Total length of the video = < 5min
All shoot with redmi smartphone.

Scene0
============
Location: River near the descent of the road. 
Make shure that no people is in the frame.
Video length: 30 sec
Topic: General idea of a simulated worlds. How the laws of physics can be simulated in crude more simple form. 
Text(narrated from paper): "In the last podcast Sabine Hossenfelder said that the idea of simulation is not scientific because nobody
ever created such detailed worlds that includes odour for example. I always was into this idea. I translate work of Tom Campbell into russian.
I created a document called requirement for the simulation. Ill try to understand or better say imagine the physics alternative to what we know from physics books."



Timeline of the person that live in a simulation can be viewed in context of a tecnological singularity.
First simulation was very slow and run 1000 times slower than real time.
-- Short introduction or summary of storyline "permutation city".
Text can be readed from wiki in home. Show pictures from The Matrix and scene with "leather armchair and tv"
Scene with "lady in red"

-- Short introduction or summary of storyline "the matrix".
Text can be readed from wiki in home.

Topic2: Difference in real time and simulated time.

Scene1
============
Video length: 10 sec
Some words about myself. My story.

Describe how i work on the game engine design. What questions i ask to myself.
Present evidence to the public of that my life can be simulated.
EVIDENCE 1: i live promaraly in two locations. In one small part of a saint-petesburg and on the countryside
I never be in any other locations.
EVIDENCE 2: I rarely met with people in the real world. I talk to people on dicord.
EVIDENCE 3: Problems with discord connection. People on discord rarely turn on webcam video
EVIDENCE 4: snack like snickers called "STEPA". Taste is just like original "SNICKERS"
EVIDENCE 5: Internet in Russia is limited. Many sites can be accessed only with vpn.

Scene2
============
Location: home
Video length: 2 min
I sitting and reading old soviet newspapers and journals.
Topic: Data in simulation can be from a real world before the people was loaded.
Also data can be completely sintesyzed.
TODO: Select pictures from vokrug sveta, ogonyok.
